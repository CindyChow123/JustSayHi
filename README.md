# Description:
Just Say Hi is a 2D puzzle game featuring character restoration through object rotation. The playerâ€™s goal is to restore the writings of each character graph they are shown by limited steps, based on hints about what the characters look like. Clicking one stick, the player can select it, rotate it by keyboards and see its remaining rotation steps. They can also call out the hint image for characters, which show up for a few seconds, and check their results by clicking the corresponding buttons.
